# Lab7_fun-with-calculators
Lab partners: Nina Weddige, Muhammad Jazzar
Lab tasks: 

1) Implement the missing functionality for single digit numbers and only one operator discovered in the pre-lab.

2) Extend your integer calculator without making any changes to your superclasses except for changing privates to protected to include buttons for entering in the hexadecimal digits. Make the calculator do its calculations and display in hexadecimal notation.

3) Integrate a checkbox for switching between decimal and hexadecimal formats. Do not show the hexadecimal digits (or grey them out) when you have the calculator in decimal mode.
